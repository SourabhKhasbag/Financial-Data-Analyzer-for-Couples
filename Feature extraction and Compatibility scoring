The outputfile'Features.csv' contains 2 types of Output values.
Values that are Fact-Based(Student,Married,Divorced): Such values are represented as boolean(1-Yes,0-No)
Values which are Quantifiable(ExIncome,Expense,ArtLover,MusicLover..all others except the ones mentioned above)
These values are represnted using numbers: The numbers denote the total expenses occured in that category.


To find the compatibility of a 2 individuals I hvae undertaken the following methodology:
The Features are divided into 3 classes:
Maximum priority(default value):['Income','Expense','Divorced',"Student",'Married']
These features have a higher weightage as compared with others. Therefore they get the maximum priority while computing the score.
Medium priority(default value):[]
These features have lesser weightage as compared with others. Therefore they get the medium priority while computing the score.
Lowest priority(default value):'PartyPerson','Pets','Tardy','HealthFreak','Bibulious','Intellectual','ArtLover','Geeky','Sports','MusicLover','CoffeeLover'
These features have lowest weightage as compared with others. Therefore they get the lowest priority while computing the score.

Before computing the actual score the values are quantified:
Quantification analysis:
The importance of a particular Feature in a person's life can be attributed to the frequncey of that Freature(read transaction) and
the total amount of transaction.
Step 1 :
A score for every Feature is calculated by mapping the amount spent on a particular Feature to a percentage based on the total expense of the user.
(Total money spent of Feature/Total Expense of user)*100
Such a score is calculated for both the users
Step2:
The difference between each Feature score of the users is calculated .(ex user1(feature1Score)-user2(feature1Score))
Step 3:
The value from Step 2 is multipled with the assocoiated weigth of the particular Feature(exWeight[Feature]*difference)
The value is then mapped between 0-1 by simply dividing by the maximum possible answer

The program has been written in such a way that in future an user may be asked for his priority in Features
